ESP32 Microcontroller
Acts as the main processing and control unit of the system. It collects sensor data, performs power calculations, and transmits data wirelessly to the cloud using built-in Wi-Fi.

Current Sensor (ACS712)
Used to measure the current consumed by the electrical load. It provides accurate, real-time current measurements and is suitable for low-cost energy monitoring applications.

Voltage Sensor Module
Measures the AC mains voltage and provides a scaled-down analog signal to the ESP32 for safe processing and voltage calculation.

LCD Display (16×2 / OLED Display)
Displays real-time electrical parameters such as voltage, current, power, and energy consumption locally.

Relay Module
Enables remote switching and control of electrical loads. It provides isolation between high-voltage loads and low-voltage control circuitry.

Wi-Fi Network / Internet Connection
Required for transmitting measured data from the ESP32 to cloud platforms or mobile applications for remote monitoring.

Power Supply Unit (5V / 3.3V Regulated Supply)
Supplies stable operating voltage to the ESP32 and other system components.

Load (Bulb / Fan / Appliance)
Represents the electrical device whose power consumption is monitored by the system.

Connecting Wires and Breadboard / PCB
Used for interconnecting components during prototyping or for permanent mounting in PCB form.

Resistors and Capacitors
Used for signal conditioning, filtering, and voltage regulation where required.
